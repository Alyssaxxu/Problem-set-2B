PROJECT TITLE: Problem set 2B: ordered pairs
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
VERSION or DATE: Sep 21, 2023
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Alyssa Xu
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Consider Questions:
To create a new object right click and create a new object using the constructors or you can create the objects manually by coding:
OrderedPair origin = new OrderedPair();
OrderedPair orderedPair1 = new OrderedPair (4.0, -5.0);
If you print an orderedPair to the console, it will not be properly formatted like (x,y) 

After adding the behaviour methods, the orderedPair will print formatted properly.
